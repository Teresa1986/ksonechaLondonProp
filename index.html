          Highdorn Group is a property management group that manages both
          commercial and residential properties in the UK. Highdorn is owned and
          controlled by the Freshwater family. Almost all the properties
          Highdorn manages are owned by two property investment groups -
          <a href="https://daejanholdings.com/">Daejan Holdings</a> and
          <a href="#">Centremanor Group</a> that are also owned and controlled
          by the Freshwater family. Colloquially these groups together are known
          as the
          <a href="https://freshwatergroup.co.uk/">Freshwater Group</a> although
          this is not a legal entity. The latest news relating to the Freshwater Group can be found on that website.

          <div>Highdorn employs most of the people in the Freshwater Group and supplies their services to other groups and companies within the Freshwater Group.  Details relevant to employment matters are therefore included in this website, for example details of the Defined Benefit Pension Scheme. </p></div>
